# kaggle-intensive-genai

This project is a showcase of my journey in learning and implementing Generative AI concepts as part of the 5-Day Intensive Course offered by Google and Kaggle.

## Overview

Throughout this project, I will explore various concepts and techniques in Generative AI, including but not limited to:

- Structured output/JSON mode/controlled generation
- Few-shot prompting
- Document understanding
- Image understanding
- Video understanding
- Audio understanding
- Function calling
- Agents
- Long context window
- Context caching
- Gen AI evaluation
- Grounding
- Embeddings
- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
- Vector search/vector store/vector database
- MLOps (with GenAI)

The primary model used for this project will be **Gemini Flash 2.0**.

## Capstone Project

As a culmination of this learning journey, I will develop a **Virtual Study Buddy**. This application will leverage the concepts and tools explored during the course to provide an interactive and intelligent study companion.

Stay tuned for updates as I progress through this exciting learning experience!
